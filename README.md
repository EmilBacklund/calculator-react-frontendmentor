### What I learned

I have gained valuable experience by creating my first project using React and styled-components 💅
The process of developing the calculator app learned me a lot, improved my skills on how to work with props in React, better understand the useState hook, refresh my knowledge of switch statements in JavaScript, and use styled-components effectively. I plan to build similar projects in the future while exploring new tools like Chakra, Tailwind, and Material UI.

Also interested to try different js framweorks when I feel a bit more comfortable with React, like Solid JS, Svelte, Vue, Angular etc.
